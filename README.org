Emacs commands to reformat current text-block into single line or multiple lines. (similar to fill-region, but strickly exchange spaces with newline, or vice versa.)

This is useful for languages that consider whitespace equivalent. For example, HTML, XML, CSS. (and lisp, but except comment code or string.) 

In the future, this package will expand to also pretty-format. That is, from single long lines of code into multiple-lines with good choice of line-breaks and also indented, and skip line comments or string.
