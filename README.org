reformat current text-block into single line or multiple lines.
(similar to fill-region, but strickly exchange spaces with newline, or vice versa.)

In the future, this package will expand to also pretty-format. That is, from single long lines of code into multiple-lines with good choice of line-breaks and also indented.
